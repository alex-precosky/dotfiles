# dotfiles
My unix dotfiles managed by GNU stow

Since I have a lot of command lines running everywhere and new ones all the time, I need an easy way to sync my config files!  
GNU stow to the resuce!

# usage

Clone the repository in your homer directory. Then you can...

```
cd dotfiles
```

And then, for example, to install the zsh settings...

```
stow zsh
```
